# QAC-307-Catholic-School-Makeup-Analysis

I will be looking to see if there exists a significant relationship between whether a child in the study attended a private catholic school and their score on a 
standardized cognitive assessment in math. With that, I will look at how different factors like the highest education level of the child’s parents, the yearly income of the 
child’s family, and the number of places that student has lived for at least 4 months all have an effect on the child’s score. I think this will be interesting to look at for 
several reasons, largely because I believe that it will highlight the inequalities that exist in our education system. For instance, the analysis could show that students who 
attended private Catholic schools received better scores on the standardized test, which would demonstrate the unequal educations that students who attend expensive private 
schools and students who attend public schools get. Moreover, it will be interesting to see how income levels and the highest level of education relate to all of this, as the
data could show even further the impact of cycles of poverty that families cannot escape from.
